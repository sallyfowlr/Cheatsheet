            <td>"article {}"</td>
            <td>CSS type selectors are used to match all elements of a given type or tag name. Unlike for HTML syntax, we do not include the angle brackets when using type selectors for tag names.</td>
          </tr>

            <td>Class Selectors</td>
            <td>".article {}"</td>
            <td>The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents of their <em>class</em> attribute. For selecting elements having "article" as the value of the class attribute, a . needs to be prepended.</td>

            <td>ID Selectors</td>
            <td>"#article {}"</td>
            <td>The CSS ID selector matches elements based on the contents of their id attribute. The values of id attribute should be unique in the entire DOM. For selecting the element having "article" as the value of the id attribute, a # needs to be prepended.</td>

            <td>Decendant Selectors</td>
            <td>"div span {}"</td>
            <td>The CSS descendant selector combinator is used to match elements that are descended from another matched selector. They are denoted by a single space between each selector and the descended selector. div span will match all span elements that are inside a div element.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>!important</td>
          <td>The CSS !important rule is used on declarations to override any other declarations for a property and ignore selector specificity. !important rules will ensure that a specific declaration always applies to the matched elements. However, generally it is good to avoid using !important as bad practice.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>font-weight</td>
          <td>The font-weight CSS property can be used to set the weight (boldness) of text. The provided value can be "normal (400)", "bold (700)", "bolder", "lighter" or a number between 100 and 1000.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>text-align</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>opacity</td>
          <td>The opacity CSS property can be used to control the transparency of an element. The value of this property ranges from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque).</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Resource URL</td>
          <td>In CSS, the url() function is used to wrap resource URLs. These can be applied to several properties such as the background-image.</td>

        <tr>
